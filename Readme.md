# Investigate a Dataset

## Introduction

I worked on **No show appointment dataset**. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. This dataset contains fourteen (14 features(columns)) that characterizes a patient 

### Dataset Description 

>Patientid-a number to identify a patient

>AppointmentID- the number to identify the appointment

>Gender- represents the sex of the patient

>ScheduledDay- represents the day and time the patient scheduled his/her appointment
 
>AppointmentDay- describes the day and time of apointment

>handicap- tells if the patient is an handicapped or not

>SMS_recieved- tells the number of sms a patient received regarding the appointment

### Question(s) for Analysis

> Which gender show up for appointment the most?

> Which age range show up the most for appointment?

> Does having scholarship influence the number of patients that show up for appointment ?

> What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

> Which gender showed up most for appointment with or without scholarship?

> Do patients without diabetes and hipertension show up for appointment??
